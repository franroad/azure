The idea of this undergoing project is to deploy different resources in azure using Terraform and then provide the software through Ansible.
Using the Terraform file the resources that I am deploying are the following:

-ACR
-VM ( podman)
-VM (ansible)
-AKS (persistent volume)

I am currently finalizing the Terraform with the desired resources, these can be found: https://github.com/franroad/azure/tree/main/terraform
